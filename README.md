Automating the process of tackling Depression with the help of Machine Learning. <br>

## Abstract

Depression is a common mental disorder that causes people to experience <br>
->depressed mood<br>
->loss of interest or pleasure<br>
->feelings of guilt or low self-worth<br>
->disturbed sleep or appetite<br>
->low energy<br>
->poor concentration.<br>
There are many problems we are dealing with, today like terrorism, poverty, corruption. We can say these are the known enemies but depression is the unknown enemy of society and we all know that:<br>
"An Unknown Enemy is more dangerous than a Known one"<br>
 BUT <br>
There is a problem which is bigger than depression and that is its DETECTION<br>
=>Studies have shown that most of the people who are suffering from depression don't even know that they are in the depression. That means they don't feel the need to visit a doctor<br>
=>And even if they consult a doctor, then also it is not necessary that the doctor will correctly diagnose it. i.e a doctor cannot perform this task accurately.<br>
So some automatic and reliable means of depression recognition is required.<br>
BUT DON'T WORRY<br>
We are in an age of Machine Learning & Artificial Intelligence and we can assign this task to machines which will perform this task at much good accuracy than humans.<br>
As depressed people behave differently from normal people which can be detected in audio and visual recordings of the patient. Studies have shown that depressed people tend to avoid eye contact, engage less in verbal communication, speak anxiously in short phrases and monotonously.<br>
### OUR AIM<br>
is to develop an ML model which will predict if a person is suffering from depression or not using audio, visual and text features.<br>
